/**
 * TaskTracer is a tool for tracing Source Events, Source Events are usually
 * some kinds of platform events we're interested in, such as input event, timer
 * event, network event... etc. When a source event is created, it also generates
 * a chain of Tasks/nsRunnables, and these Tasks/nsRunnables are dispatched to
 * multiple threads or processes. However, the profiler we have in current lack
 * the ability of tracing correlation between these tasks. TaskTracer provides
 * a way to record information of each tasks (latency, execution time... etc.),
 * and which source event is this task originally dispatched from, given
 * developers a clear scope of the correlation between tasks and runnables.
